Hello! i'm a software engineer, or someone learning to become one.
See, I mainly play games including but not limited to; CoD, Roblox, and Minecraft.
I don't want to risk getting my accounts on games I play getting banned, so you won't be able to get my profile details. (unless you already know me of course.)
Things about me that I do; Mainly exploit on certain games for fun. Sometimes code a few projects here and there.
I'm anonymous everywhere. I set multiple personalities and no one knows my real identity, You may attempt to dox me, However it will be difficult to do.
You can donate to my projects at my BTC wallet; 1di1cgeYxCQcy6KhrTh29tyGUUyBzYeD6
I'm likely not going to post much here, just some things for anyone who finds it to use.


In the making of a 180+ scripts GUI.
The GUI is going to be based of Roblox's exploiting.
I'm lazy however, so around 20% of things will be skidded.
No, this GUI won't be paid, however it will have a login, due to it's special "add script" feature. We don't want anyone to have special scripts logged now do we?
No, This GUI will not have a database. So I manually have to add your account to my GUI. This is done so anyone who wants access to it, needs to ask me or go through my
verification system.
Updates for the GUI won't be very frequent, likely in during months. However, I will try my best to stay online and try to update the GUI for those who use it.
The GUI is currently not out yet, However you may add my discord and ask for Beta Access. I will only add those who i feel welcomed with. Any attempt of social
-engineering will get you imidiately blacklisted from the GUI. I repeat in better words; No asking for GUI Access repeatedly if I said No. 
I will grant you access if I feel like you deserve it. After all, I own it.
Again; The GUI is not out yet. It likely won't be until next year or a few years later. This is going to be one of my biggest projects i've made so far.


Likely no one is going to have access to my GUI. It's features are way too rare for any sort of distribution.
